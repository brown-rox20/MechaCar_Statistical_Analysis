## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<img alt="summary of linear progression of mpg" title="summary of linear progression of mpg" src="https://github.com/brown-rox20/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/static/images/deliverable_1.png">

**Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**

- Looking at the summary above we can see that the vehicle length and ground clearance of the car heavily affect the mpg rating of the car.

**Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

- The slope of the linear model cannot be considered zero due to our `p-value` which was `5.35e-11`.

**Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**

- With an R squared value of `0.7149`, or a 71% success rate, we can say this model does predict the mpg of MechaCar effectively.
